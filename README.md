## Project Description
## `"ADOPT THE BELOVED OF YOUR LIFE"`
More than 100 shelters, humane societies, and pet rescue groups are part of the Home for-Pet.com family, and these groups rely on being able to post various profiles of homeless pets on Home-for-Pet.com free of charge. A dog or cat only has a chance to find a home when they are seen, and your gift helps ensure this happens each and every day.
